>This was my first 3D printer, and I'm more than pleased with it!Coming into this, I knew absolutely nothing about 3D printers. I did some research and finally decided on this model. I watched a few YouTube reviews, and everyone seemed to have mostly positive things to say, especially compared to other models in the price range.

>Building the unit was super easy, as there were only three main parts to assemble with a handful of screws. Once you have everything unpacked, you attach the gantry to the base, the print head to the gantry, and you're good to go. I checked the belt tension and z-axis alignment and everything was fine with my unit, but I suggest checking yours before moving on to be safe.

>The first few days were the hardest. Leveling the bed wasn't something I knew how to do or that I needed to do it at all. I watched a few tutorials and gave it a shot. It's a trial and error process, so don't be discouraged if your first few prints look like garbage. There's nothing wrong with your printer; you're just doing something wrong - I'm speaking from experience here. Once you get the hang of what you're doing during the leveling process, you'll quickly get it to a place where things are looking good.

>Then, the next adventure beginsâ€”the software.

>I'm not talking about the software included on the SD card. I didn't even bother to install that and went straight to Cura instead. Cura has a very user-friendly interface, but once you start to dig into the more advanced options, you start to see how complex the 3D printing process can be. That's no fault of this printer, either. That's just the nature of how these things work. I must have printed half a dozen Benchy's before I got it to look the way it should. The two biggest tips I can give you are this:
>
>- Update the firmware. As of this writing, the current version on the Mingda website is 2.8.2. I don't remember what version mine was before I flashed it, but I know that it was several versions older.
>
>- After you finish the firmware update, Connect the printer to your computer with a USB cable, download Pronterface (Google it), and run a PID autotune. I won't go into the details here, but there's plenty of tutorials on YouTube. It's only a few simple commands, and it helps to get your printer calibrated properly.

>I tried printing the first two things with the starter filament included in the box. Don't even bother with this. I had bought a spool of PLA+ from eSUN, and as soon as I switched to that filament, the difference was night and day. The pictures I've included were all printed with the eSUN filament after a proper leveling and PID autotune. On the 3D Printer Test, I left it exactly as it was when I took it off the build plate. There was no bridging and VERY minimal stringing. Nothing that would affect the final quality and can easily be removed. Satisfied with those results, I got to printing a few useful things. The next pictures are a desk-mounted headphone clamp with a tightening bolt and a solder fume extractor. All the threaded parts came out perfectly, and everything aligned as it should.

>As a total 3D printing novice, This whole experience has been a little frustrating (not in part to the machine itself) but very rewarding. Once you get a handle on the major aspects of how this works, you'll be 3D printing anything you can imagine. I have nothing to compare this specific printer to, but I can tell you that after 40+ hours of printing time, I haven't had a single failed print or printer malfunction yet. If you're looking to get into the world of 3D printing and don't want to drop major cash on something, this is the printer to buy.
